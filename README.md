# LumiAnalysis

`LumiAnalysis` is an application that runs over luminosity data from ATLAS to provide the following capabilities:
* Visualization and regression of instantaneous luminosity from a reference algorithm w.r.t. LAr currents
* Visualization of average instantaneous luminosity with respect to a reference algorithm over multiple runs (i.e. "drift" w.r.t. that algorithm)

No ATLAS data is included; this is meant to be a showcase of my code rather than a working application.
